# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis | Internship Task 2

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **Data Science with Python Internship – Task 2** at **Maincrafts Technology**.

The objective of this project is to analyze the Titanic dataset to understand survival patterns among passengers using Python. It focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization to generate meaningful insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and explore the Titanic dataset  
- Handle missing and inconsistent data  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Analyze survival patterns  
- Create meaningful visualizations  
- Answer real-world analytical questions  

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- Platform: Kaggle (for dataset)  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Name:** Titanic Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data  

**Description:**  
The dataset contains passenger information such as:
- Passenger Class (Pclass)  
- Gender (Sex)  
- Age  
- Fare  
- Embarked Port  
- Survival Status  

This dataset is widely used for learning data analysis and machine learning concepts.

## 📊 Tasks Performed
✔ Data Loading  
✔ Data Cleaning  
✔ Missing Value Handling  
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis  
✔ Data Visualization  
✔ Pattern Analysis  
✔ Insight Generation

## 📈 Visualizations
The following visualizations are included in this project:

- Survival by Gender (Bar Chart)  
- Survival by Passenger Class (Bar Chart)  
- Age Distribution (Histogram)  

These plots help in understanding key survival trends.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate than males  
- First-class passengers showed better survival chances  
- Younger passengers had relatively higher survival probability  
- Lower-class passengers were more vulnerable
